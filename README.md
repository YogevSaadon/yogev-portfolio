# Yogev Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React and Vite.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

**BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:**
1. **UNDERSTAND THE FULL PROJECT** - Read through all relevant files and components
2. **MAP THE DEPENDENCIES** - Understand how CSS, components, and themes interact
3. **CHECK EXISTING PATTERNS** - Look at how similar functionality is implemented
4. **IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSES** - Don't make surface-level fixes without understanding why issues exist
5. **TEST HOLISTICALLY** - Verify changes work across the entire project, not just isolated components

**NEVER make changes without first understanding the complete context and architecture.**

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
